## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

By using height: 100vh; along with flexbox and justify-content: center;, we can center the card without needing to set top, left, and use transform: translate(-50%, -50%);.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

You can use this:

```css
body {
...
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Instead of this:

```css
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```

### Continued development

Iâ€™d like to continue learning about positioning with simpler code.
